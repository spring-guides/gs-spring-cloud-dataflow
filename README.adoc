== Getting Started with Spring Cloud Data Flow
This guide walks you through an overview of Spring Cloud Data Flow and the process of orchestrating an event-driven
streaming and short-lived batch data pipelines.

=== What is Spring Cloud Data Flow?
A microservices-based Streaming and Batch data processing in Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. You can learn more about
the Spring Cloud Data Flow from the link:https://dataflow.spring.io/[Microsite],
link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-dataflow#learn[documentation],
and link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-samples[samples].

Furthermore, you can read Spring Cloud Data Flow's link:https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/concepts/architecture/[architecture and the building blocks]
to familiarize yourself.

=== Spring Cloud Data Flow and Pre-built Streaming Applications
In the following guide, you will create and deploy a streaming data pipeline using pre-built applications.

=== Spring Cloud Data Flow and Custom Streaming Applications
In the following guide, you will create and deploy a streaming data pipeline using custom applications.

=== Spring Cloud Data Flow and Simple Task
In the following guide, we demonstrate how to register a Spring Cloud Task application with Data Flow, create a Task
definition, and launch the Task definition on Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and your local machine.

=== Spring Cloud Data Flow and Batch Jobs
In the following guide, we demonstrate how to register a Spring Batch application with Data Flow, create a task definition,
and launch the task definition on Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and your local machine.

=== Spring Cloud Data Flow and Composed Task
In the following guide, we demonstrate how to orchestrate a Composed Task with a combination of both a simple task
and a batch job application.

== Summary
Congratulations! You have completed Spring Cloud Data Flow's high-level overview, and you were able to build, deploy, and
launch streaming and batch data pipelines in Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, and Local.
